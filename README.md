# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discuss the topic of artifical intelligence and its possible impact on society with the help of two articles.

## Article 1
In this article, [Did ChatGPT Write This Article?](https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/did-chatgpt-write-article), it delves into the possiblity of what AI can accomplish, especially with the introduction of ChatGPT. While the technology hasn't been perfected, ChatGPT is a huge accomplishment on what AI can do today. It can bring a mulititude of benefits, such as students and teachers can use it to create a better learning environment for each other.

However, because it can only be given limited content by its human operator, it will operated under thinking biased towards its human operater, meaning it won't be completely accurate. Despite that, this technology will clearly have an impact on our future.

## Article 2
In this artcle, [12 Risks and Dangers of AI](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence), it goes into the 12 possible dangers that AI brings. Most of what the articles goes over is the ethical use of AI is very questionable. The use of AI can be used to manipulate society in a negative way, such as financial crisis because of biased context or loss of human influence that can lead to loss of important functions in creative/empathetic fields such as writing and healthcare.

However, this article realizes that AI can still be used in an ethical way. It highlights the importance of this, and as long as it is adhered to, AI can be a powerful tool that businesses can use to further improve tasks. There just needs to be a humane perspective when using AI.
